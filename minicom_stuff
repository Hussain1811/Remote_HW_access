You might be able to see boot logs in the serial of minicom, but you may not reach the prompt sometimes.
For this to work, do the following:

Minicom -s ---> serial port setup ---> change serial device; make hardware flow control to "NO".
If still it's not working, try to change the baud rate and check.
