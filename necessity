1)You can do remote debugging via GDB.

(a)Establish tunnel for GDB:

To forward local port 49188 to gdb port, say 2345, then:
ssh -f -N -L 49188:<IP of target>:2345 userid@machine_ip/name

(b)In eclipse config, do the following:
Host: localhost
Port number: 49188

Â©in target:
gdbserver localhost:2345 <binary>

But, above might be extremely slow if there are many intermediate hosts between your system and the final target.
So, better thing to do is: connect to the system to which the target is connected via:

sudo ssh -L localhost:49188:<IP of target>:2345 <IP of target> 

Now, you can't use eclipse because you won't have the sources on this host machine where the target is connected to. So, you should run GDB from command line as:
target remote localhost:49188

2)You can get DLT logs.
